# Parrot
Primitive OpenGL (ES) based graphics library and engine for Android development.
Parrot makes Android core graphics simpler, giving you the features you need without the heavy usual bulk of core graphics development.

# Progress
Parrot is still very early in development, currently in a raw and primitive phase that still requires some core graphics and Java knowledge.
